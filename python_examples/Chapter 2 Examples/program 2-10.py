#Program 2-10 (variable_demo4.py)

#This program demonstrates variable reassignment.
#Assign a value to the dollars variable.
dollars = 2.75
print('I have', dollars, 'in my account')

#Reassign dollars so it referemces a different value
dollars = 99.95
print('but now I have', dollars, 'in my account')

#reassign the variable for a second data set.
dollars = 1000.00
print('It seems I have', dollars, 'in my wallet')

#reassign the value
dollars = 0.00
print('looks like they robbed me. I only have', dollars, 'in my account')

#reassign data for a third example.

dollars = 200.00
print('this week is pretty slow, I only have', dollars, 'until I get paid')

#reassign the value

dollars = 800.00
print('payday! Looks like I just got paid', dollars,)
